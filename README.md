# learning-airflow
This repository documents my journey through the **Airflow 101 (Airflow 3)** Learning Path by Astronomer Academy [](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101). The goal is to master Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines, using the Astro CLI to run Airflow locally.

## Progress
- **Current Status**: Completed 3/11 modules, exploring the Airflow UI and DAGs.
- **Detailed Progress**: See [docs/learning_progress.md](docs/learning_progress.md) for a detailed log of completed modules and current activities.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: Contains documentation, including learning progress and notes.
- `dags/`: (Future) Will store sample DAG files as I create them.
- `README.md`: Project overview and links to resources.

## Tools Used
- **Astro CLI**: For running Airflow locally.
- **Apache Airflow 3**: The workflow orchestration platform.
- **GitHub**: For version control and progress tracking.

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining modules of the Airflow 101 Learning Path.
- Create and test a sample DAG.
- Share learnings with the Airflow community.
